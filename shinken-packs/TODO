* Translate the comments in english.

* In check_snmp_head, put just the common options,
  the other options must be defined in each check_snmp_foo.

* The output of the checks must respect the standard output format
  of nagios plugins.

* Why not try to write the plugins in Python. See lab/ directory.
  But I think there is a performance problem. Try to compile in
  .pyc before to test.

* Indent like this the *.cfg files:
    define service {
        service_description disk space
        use                 generic-service_tpl
        register            0
        host_name           windows_tpl
        check_command       check_windows_disks
    }

* Make a nice picture in /usr/share/shinken-packs/sp.example.cfg
  which represents the templates etc.

* Update the README file.

* Why not a Oriented Object version of sp_merge_conf

* In the https_tpl, rename the "_https_certificates" key
  to "_https_cert".

* Create the "http-anyhost_tpl" and "https-anyhost_tpl"
  templates like "http_tpl" and "https_tpl" except that
  the http[s] requests (and the certificate check) don't
  use the -I option (the address of the host) and the
  dns resolution be sent during the execution of the
  check. Find too a syntax to choice the detination
  host:
    - an empty argument -> the dns resolution be sent during the execution of the check
    - an non empty argument -> use the argument for the address of the destination host
