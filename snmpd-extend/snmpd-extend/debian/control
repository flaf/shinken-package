Description: Scripts to extend snmpd daemon
 Scripts usable via the snmpd daemon and the extend statement.
 All these scripts are in the directory /usr/share/snmpd-extend/bin/.
 Some of them have to be launched via the sudo command. So this
 package gives some "sudo" rights to the snmp Unix account.
